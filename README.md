# Maximum-and-Minimum-of-Three-Numbers

This simple program defines two functions to find the maximum and minimum values among three numbers.

## Function Explanation

- `Max(a, b, c)`:  
  Returns the maximum value among the three input numbers using Python's built-in `max()` function.

- `Min(a, b, c)`:  
  Returns the minimum value among the three input numbers using Python's built-in `min()` function.

## How to Use

The program demonstrates the usage of these functions by printing:

- The maximum of three example numbers `(15, 18, 25)`.
- The minimum of three example numbers `(64, 17, 42)`.

### Example Output
maximum: 25
minimum 17
